**htmltoadf is an HTML to Atlassian Document Format (ADF) converter written in Rust.**

The library can be used in several different ways:
* As a command line binary (either directly on a compatible host or using Docker)
* Included as a library within a Rust project
* Called from a different language or environment (e.g. C, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, .NET etc.) using [FFI](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/ffi.html)
* Called as a Web Assembly (wasm) module

          "text": "Test"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Lib

### Example Rust Code

**Cargo.toml**

```toml
[dependencies]
htmltoadf = "0.1.6"
```

**Code**

```rust
use htmltoadf::convert_html_str_to_adf_str;
use serde_json::json;

let converted = convert_html_str_to_adf_str("<h1>Hello World</h1>".to_string());
let expected = json!({
    "version": 1,
    "type": "doc",
    "content": [
        {
            "type": "heading",
            "attrs": {
                "level": 1
            },
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "Hello World"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}).to_string();

assert_eq!(expected, converted);
```

### WASM

Install package from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/htmltoadf)

```javascript
import init, {convert} from "htmltoadf";
init()
  .then(() => {
    alert(convert("<h1>Hello from WebAssembly</h1>"))
  });
```

### FFI
First compile the code as a library, e.g.:

```bash
cargo build --lib --release
```

Then you can link to the library dynamic from any environment that supports a FFI.
**It is important to copy the dynamic library from the release directory, and provide a relative link to the library file from the FFI**
E.g.

#### Ruby
```ruby
require 'ffi'

module HTMLToADF
  extend FFI::Library
  ffi_lib 'libhtmltoadf'
  attach_function :convert, [ :string ], :string
end

puts HTMLToADF.convert("<h1>Hello from Ruby</h1>")
```

#### Node/JavaScript
```javascript
var ffi = require('ffi-napi');

var htmltoadf = ffi.Library('libhtmltoadf', {
  'convert': [ 'string', [ 'string' ] ]
});
console.log(htmltoadf.convert("<h1>Hello from Node!</h1>"));

```

#### Python
```python
from cffi import FFI
ffi = FFI()
lib = ffi.dlopen("libhtmltoadf")
ffi.cdef("char * convert(char *);")
print(ffi.string(lib.convert(b"<h1>Hello from Python!</h1>")))

```

## Implemented features
This converter only implements a subset of possible mappings between HTML and ADF.
The following features are implemented:
- [x] Headings
- [x] Images
- [x] Lists (ordered and unordered)
- [x] Tables

- [x] Code
- [ ] Fuzz Tests
- [ ] Support for named CSS colors

- [ ] Inline Cards
- [ ] Panels
- [ ] Emoji
- [ ] In built JSON Schema Validation

## Release Process

* Compile binaries and create release
* Build and push Docker image
* Build and push WASM NPM package
* Push crate
* Update dependency in demo page
* Push to VCS

## Testing
Run `cargo test` from the repository root.
